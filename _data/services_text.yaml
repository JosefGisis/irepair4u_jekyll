# This is text for the services page. 

# READ ME!  CAUTION! 

# Text for this website is contained in yaml. yaml (stands for: yaml ain't markup language) contains data as 
# key-value pairs, formatted as, key: value (read below for examples). To change the text for the website change
# the values (not the keys. Altering keys will cause the text not to display at all.) 

# This page allows you to add items to the corresponding webpage by adding key-value pairs that mimic the set 
# structure. Make sure to precisely mimic the key-value structure when adding items or the website will not work.

# Consistent indentation and spacing is very important in yaml. Inconsistent indentation or spacing will prevent
# the website from working.

# key-value pairs are constructed using ===> key: value

# key-values where the values are multi-line strings are constructed using ===> key: >
#                                                                                multi-line string 

# lists are created by starting of all key-value pairs with a dash, as such ===> - key: value
#                                                                                - key: value
#                                                                                - key: value

# Objects that contain multiple key-value pairs have a dash at the first key-value, as such ===> - key: value
#                                                                                                  key: value
#                                                                                                  key: value
