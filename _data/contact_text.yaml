# Text for the contact page is contained in key value pairs. Alter the values (not the keys or the 
# text will not appear on the web page) to change the text on the page. 
 
# The contact page has a fixed layout, so adding any key-value pairs will not work unless you update the liquid markup and html
# on the corresponding html file. 

# key-value pairs are constructed using ===> key: value
# key-values where the values are multi-line strings are cunstruced using ===> key: > multi-line string 
# lists are created by starting of the first key-value with a dash, as such ===> - key: value
