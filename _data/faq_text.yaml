# This is text for the faq page.

# READ ME!  CAUTION! 

# Text for this website is contained in yaml. yaml (stands for: yaml ain't markup language) contains data as 
# key-value pairs, formatted as, key: value (read below for examples). To change the text for the website change
# the values (not the keys. Altering keys will cause the text not to display at all.) 

# This page allows you to add items to the corresponding webpage by adding key-value pairs that mimic the set 
# structure. Make sure to precisely mimic the key-value structure when adding items or the website will not work.

# Consistent indentation and spacing is very important in yaml. Inconsistent indentation or spacing will prevent
# the website from working.

# key-value pairs are constructed using ===> key: value

# key-values where the values are multi-line strings are cunstruced using ===> key: >
#                                                                                multi-line string 

# lists are created by starting of all key-value pairs with a dash, as such ===> - key: value
#                                                                                - key: value
#                                                                                - key: value

# Objects that contain multiple key-value pairs have a dash at the first key-value, as such ===> - key: value
#                                                                                                  key: value
#                                                                                                  key: value

    Q. My phone fell into water. Should I put it in rice?
  A: >
    A. Save your rice for cooking. Rice not only does not help, but it can also cause more damage by making your charging
    port dirty. When your phone falls into water you need to bring it to a phone repair shop, so they can open it and dry it
    out. However, you can improve your phone’s chances of surviving by not pressing any buttons and just submerging it in
    rubbing alcohol (70% alcohol, plus). This may seem counterintuitive, but it is not the water itself that causes your phone
    to shortcuircuit; rather, it is the minerals found in water (something rubbing alcohol does not have). The rubbing alcohol 
    may save your phone while you are waiting to bring it to a repair shop.

    Q. Do you fix flip phones?
  A: >
    A. Yes we fix most flip phones. Give us a call, so we can provide more information about our services.


- Q: >
    Q. Are your replacement parts original?
  A: >
    A. Unless we can salvage a part from another phone, all parts are aftermarket. This is the case because top phone and
    tablet manufacturers do not sell original parts for their products.

 
- Q: >
    Q. Which repairs are covered by your 90 day warranty?
  A: >
    A. All repairs! We stand behind our work. So if something we fixed stops working, bring it back to us and we’ll make
    it right.


- Q: >
    Q. You recently fixed my cracked screen, but now my speaker is no longer working. Is that covered by your warranty?
  A: > 
    A. Sorry. No. Unless the speaker has stopped working due to the repair we conducted. The same goes for any damages
    not related to our work.


- Q: >
    Q. What happens if iRepair4U cannot save my damaged phone? Do I still need to pay for the attempt?
  A: >
    A. Depends. With some repairs, such as screen repairs, battery replacements,speaker repairs, etc., we will not charge
    you if we cannot fix your device. However, when it comes to water damage repairs, it is uncertain if the phone can be
    recovered and oftentimes there is nothing we can do to save the device. With those kinds of services we may still
    charge a fee.


- Q: >
    Q. Can I bring my phone over any time during business hours?
  A: >
    A. You can, but we would recommend calling us first, so we can make time for you and provide more information about your
    repair. We also may not cover your device or have the necessary parts in stock at the moment, so we suggest giving us a
    call beforehand.


- Q: >
    Q. Do you list repair prices?
  A: >
    A. Unfortunately, no. Prices may vary depending on fluctuating prices for parts. Give us a call, so we can give you a quote!
